# Pi Day Coding Competition 2021 rules

## Challenge
Build a **fully working web app** that will allow people to **query a given dataset in natural language**, providing not only the result but also some **context**.

You must:

- Tell users what your web app does and how to use it.
- Provide a text answer.
- Add context to the text answer, using any kind of data visualization.
- Set up tests. Implementing a test-driven deploy would make us even more happy.
- Host code on your Team Github. Fork this repository and send a pull request once everything has been pushed. 
- Create a Readme file for your repository with your web app public url and a summary of how you built it and who did what.

You can use every tool you like and any programming language.  
You have **2 hours to complete** the challenge.  

--> Once finished, send a pull request to your team repository. <--
